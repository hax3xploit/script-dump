## mssql-executor.py

> This code reads in SQL queries from a directory of .sql files and executes them on a Microsoft SQL Server database using the pymssql library. The updated version of the code uses threading to execute each query in a separate thread, allowing for faster execution. The code also includes error handling for database connection issues and SQL execution errors.
